On March 26, 2020 i received files from Cathy. Chlorophyll data are QA/QC and smoothed. 
For BRA_BAM_Chl I Added everything prior to Dec 2019.

Two Scripts are used to date: 
1- data_entry_script
2-General plots
These code allows integration of chl data with Q data and turbidity data from USGS and generates a new data set at 15min intervals.
For DO I will use StreamMetabolizer code to assess metabolism.
